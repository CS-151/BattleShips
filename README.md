# Battleships

This project implements one of the late 1900’s classic board game Battleships in Java programming.

## Overview

The game is developed for two players: player vs player. It is played on four 10 x 10 grids, two for each player. One grid serves as the player’s grid with their vessels marked with shots called by the opponent. Meanwhile, the other grid records the shots the player calls.

**Ship Types**
* Carrier (5)
* Battleship (4)
* Cruiser	(3)
* Submarine	(3)
* Destroyer	(2)

### How To Play The Game

1.	Launch the application
2.	On the Main Screen, click **Start**.
3.	For each player, take turns setting up your respective grids. To place a ship on the player grid:
    1. Choose whether the ship will be placed horizontally by selecting the **H** button or vertically by selecting the **V** button.
    2. Click on a block on the grid as the starting position for the ship. 
    3. Repeat the procedure for all ship types.
    4. Once all the ships are arranged, click the **Next Player** button. Pass the device to the other player.
    5. Player 2 repeats the process.
4.	Once the grids are set up, take turns guessing the location or coordinates of the opponent’s ship. 
5.	The player who manages to locate all the other player’s ship is declared the winner of the game.
